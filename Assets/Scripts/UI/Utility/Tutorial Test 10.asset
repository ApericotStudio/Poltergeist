  Title: Realtor
  Description: Here's your competition, the realtor. He has a <b>soothing presence
    for the current room</b> he's in, making it <b>impossible to scare the other
    humans while he's closeby</b>.  <br><br>He's <b>unaffected by your scares</b>,
    but he <b>can be distracted</b>. To make your scaring as effective as possible,
    I recommend luring him out of the room one way or another.
